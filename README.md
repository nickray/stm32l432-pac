# stm32l4x2

> Peripheral access API for stm32l4x2 microcontrollers

NOTE: based on the ideas from <https://github.com/nrf52-rs>

NOTE: the `stm32l4x2.svd` input is the file `svd/stm32l4x2.svd.patched` generated by <https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32-rs>, everything else is handled by `update.sh`

NOTE: we use `svd2rust` to generate the code, `form` to organize it, and `cargo fmt` to make it pretty

There are six chips in this series, the basic versions are L412, L432 and L452, each of which have a derived version with AES: L422, L442, L462.
